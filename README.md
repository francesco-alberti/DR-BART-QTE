# DR-BART-QTE
This repository contains code for estimating Quantile Treatment Effects (QTE) using Density Regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (DR-BART), as presented in Chapter 3 of my thesis:
"Density Regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees: Implications for Causal Inference". The code provides all necessary scripts to reproduce the results in Chapter 3 and is structured as follows:
- Illustrations: Sections 3.1 and 3.2;
- Simulations: Section 3.4;
- Applications: Section 3.5.
